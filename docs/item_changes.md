## Plate Locations

The sixteen Arceus plates (Pixie Plate was not added) have all been removed from their normal locations.
You can get them either from the Underground or defeating the Master Trainer of that type.
Master Trainers will appear after speaking to the old lady in the Foreign Building in Hearthome after becoming Champion.
