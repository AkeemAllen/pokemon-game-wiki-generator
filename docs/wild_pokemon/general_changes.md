* Recall that no shaking grass will appear until after the first badge has been obtained!

* 'Special' refers to the rare spots. Doubles refers to tall grass where double battles can occur.
Unless otherwise stated, fishing encounters have not been edited.

* Thanks go to Serebii.net for the images.

* You won’t be able to get all 649 in the wild alone, but evolution will make it possible! You get enough evolution stones during the course of the game for everybody, so don’t fret.

* Note that there are several sections with a “Legendary Encounter.” The legendary is a normal Wild Pokémon, just very rare. Obviously the total encounter chance can’t be 101-102%, but the Pokemon whose chance is lessened as a result is not listed. Usually, it’s just the last one in the list, so a 10% might become an 8%, a 5% might become a 4% etcetera. Although it’s somewhat untidy, this is the best method that can be done for now, due to scripting being impossible as of August 2011.

* There are a couple of differences between Blaze Black and Volt White. Namely, Blaze Black will find Zekrom, Thundurus and the pink Shellos/Gastrodon wild, as well as Red Basculin only. Volt White instead get Reshiram, Tornadus and the blue Shellos/Gastrodon wild, and Blue Basculin only. The opposites of each legendary are catchable as per usual in their regular places.
