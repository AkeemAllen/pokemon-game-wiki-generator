## Known Issues - Difficult to fix

- The Union Room lady in the top floor of the Pokémon Center has no text.
- Moonblast will not be usable if the user gets hit by Heal Block.
- Evolving a Wailmer into Wailord while in an area connecting to a Regi room will disable the warp into the Regi room until the map reloads.
- Gengar's mini sprite looks a bit strange on the Pokétch.
- Some Trainer names may appear a little odd (double battles or the actual Frontier Brain battles in the Battle Frontier).
- Some trainers in the game (notably Dawn/Lucas) give you $0 upon victory.
- The event with Rowan's briefcase in his lab might act a bit strangely if you do it just after the Distortion World is completed.
